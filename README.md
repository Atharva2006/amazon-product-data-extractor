Amazon Product Scraper 

This is a Playwright + Python scraper built to extract product titles, prices, and ASINs from amazon.in and amazon.com.

It uses stealth mode via `patchright` and exports the data to an Excel file, sorted by price.


How It Works:

       Launch Browser:
       - The script uses Playwright to launch a Chromium browser with persistent context (saves login, cookies, etc.).

       User Input:
       - Youâ€™re prompted to enter a valid Amazon search URL (either .in or .com).

       Scraping Loop:

       - It scrapes product titles and prices from the first 2 pages of the search results:
       - Locates each product block.
       - Extracts the product title and price.
       - Skips items without proper ASIN or missing data.

       Pagination:
       - After scraping a page, it clicks the "Next" button and waits for the next page to load.

       Excel Output:

       - Saves the scraped data to an Excel file.
       - Cleans and converts price to numeric.
       - Removes duplicates and sorts products by price (ascending).
       - Overwrites the file with the cleaned, sorted data.
